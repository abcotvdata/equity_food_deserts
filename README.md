This is a combination of USDA's Food Access Research Atlas and racial/ethnic demographics for all U.S. census tracts. File notes the state, county and metro area of the tract as well.

The csv file includes the yes/no flag for whether or not the Census tract was flagged as having low-access to a grocery or supermarket with healthy food, according to the USDA's Food Access Research Atlas.

Because people live in all corners of a tract, to be more precise, the flag indicates for the tract, whether "at least 500 people, or 33 percent of the population, living more than one-half mile (urban areas) or 10 miles (rural areas) from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store." The tract is marked 1 if it is low access and is marked 0 if not.

For the purposes of our broad analysis across metro areas, we chose to use this simplest measure of distance of the healthy food resource from people regardless of other factors.

The raw version of the Atlas includes additional measures that take into account the share of people in low income categories and people without access to vehicles, among other factors. More detail is available here, along with raw data and documentation for those who want to delve into other measures: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/documentation/
