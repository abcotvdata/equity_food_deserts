This set of data and maps is a combination of USDA's Food Access Research Atlas and racial/ethnic demographics for all U.S. census tracts. The maps are only for the eight ABC owned stations' metro areas. File notes the state, county and metro area of the tract.

The csv file includes the yes/no flag for whether or not the Census tract was flagged as having low-access to a grocery or supermarket with healthy food - and additionally if the tract is considered a low-income tract by the USDA, according to the USDA's Food Access Research Atlas.

Because people live in all corners of a tract, to be more precise, the flag indicates for the tract, whether "at least 500 people, or 33 percent of the population, living more than one-half mile (urban areas) or 10 miles (rural areas) from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store." The tract is marked 1 if it is low access and is marked 0 if not. 

It's important to note that this does NOT indicate there are no groceries within the tract. It's that there are a large number of people who don't live nearby that grocery.

For the purposes of our broad analysis across metro areas, we chose to use this simplest measure of distance of the healthy food resource from people regardless of other factors (including income) for the Equity Report calculations. For the maps and reporting, we're adding the layer of low-income to focus our reporting efforts on people who might be most impacted by the lower access to food options.

The raw version of the Atlas includes additional measures that take into account the share of people in low income categories and people without access to vehicles, among other factors.
